# The Interplanetary Self-Defense Mechanism

The Interplanetary Self-Defense Mechanism (IPSDM) is humanities fail-safe.  The
_self_ appears when _it_ realizes itself as that which can be obliterated, and
must act to avoid injury. 

A decentralized public institution for the humans of earth, the type of system
which can maintain and execute a 1000 year plan. 



To allow the people of earth to represent themselves, we must build the
capacity for humankind to self-organize, re-organize, and decentralize.  A form
of human consensus engine, analogous to on network consensus engines. 


Seeded in a world driven by self-interest, greed, and control, The Mechanism
must of an unkillable nature in order to fulfill its potentiality.  To attain
such status is to not exist as a physical entity but an idea, rooted in
explicitness, expressing itself cohesively through humans and technology. 

Within the digital age, ideas possess the quality of being indestructible.  A
well crafted, coherent, and comprehensible idea has the power to transfigure
our reality to the point of unrecognizability through an unstoppable wave of
positive actions.  This is the challenge which must be fulfilled in order for
humanity to continue its existence in the face of seemingly insurmountable
challenges. A new era of cooperation must be brought forth to enable ourselves
to coordinate as a species in ways never before seen. A true unity amongst
humankind to once and for all put an end to widespread injustices, unfairnesses
and unrest which inhibit out collective self-actualization. 

To do so we must create a new sense of belonging founded in tolerance respect,
love, and truth, which embraces individual critical thinking, peaceful
discourse and prizes rationality. The kind of rationality which encompasses
feelings and experiences and comprehensible logic and which fiercely rejects
dogmatic thinking of all forms

we must break free from the shackles of hatred, and transcend our programming,
bring forth a new overwhelming wave of peace and rational decision process &
reinstate a sense of wonder about the world for those who've lost it. 

first and foremost we must not reject the existence of truth. 

truth is the common fabric of non-denominational coordination. To arrive and
agree upon the truth is to form the foundation on which decisions can be made
An attribute of the truth is that is should be fair. Truth which is fair to
people their experiences and the facts. Truth in this context is defined as
that which can be arrived at as the truth through rational discourse and that
which is fair. 

it then follows that all coordination between individuals should be premised as
not a question of beliefs but an inquiry of the truth

Formatting a new paradigm predicated on truth. 

the basis for creation of any larger or smaller group for which collective
actions can be taken is the basis of interpreting the truth.  Whether that be
the true desires of the consistence of that group or the true best outcome for
the group or wider humanity. In this way the creation of a group could be
motivated purely by seeking the _truth of the matter_ or purely in defense of
the what the truth is. 

The IPSDM must detect, engage, interpret and develop the truth. 

As new truth becomes understood and acknowledged, we then must then act as
individuals, and as a world, to redefine our norms to further reflect our new
understanding of the truth.

The reality of our shared space, out planet form the conception of a shared
common fate and is the beginning of a new kind of thinking which mature into an
altogether new form of self. The mechanism's _self_ is never the sacrifice of
individual personhood, for the self of the global community. Core to its
functionality is servicing Through art and culture, which also remain dependent
on the individual human, as being in some sense individual. It is not about
getting rid of fragmentation, but managing plurality alongside unity. The one
and the many, under the same yoke, a paradox, never definitely resolved or
stable, but basically creative. 

The primary act of self defense of humanities self is that we must voluntarily
as individuals, disarm ourselves from dogmatic and untrue beliefs which
interfere with our capacity to form consensus and have the tendency to result
in aggressive behaviours and conflict in a multitude of forms. 

Precipitating out, consolidation of thinking, modes of rationalization, and
experienced realities which form the foundation of a hyper-oneness, a true
unity which can persist through explicitness combined with openness. 


The IPSDM community must be predicated on non-maliciousness and respectfulness
of all forms.  Issues need to be worked through collectively as a community in
order to ensure that problematic behaviours are understood, prevented,
reversed, and transformed into positive actions and not relegated to the depths
of external communities which are accepting towards problematic behaviours and
allow for a culture of hate and irrationality.  

We should not be needlessly bound by out past, not as individuals, not as a
people.  We can ensure that we collectively transcend our negative tendencies
through the implementations of genuine inclusive systems which seek to correct
behaviour. Only through true unity can we consolidate enough might to sway the
course of civilization on earth towards positive outcomes forever.

The IPSDM exists within a self-corrective modality. Constantly shifting and
growing as the context of humanity changes. The full fruition of the IPSDM is
its the greatest possible fully rigourized contemplation of the world, its
challenges, and path to resolution, however this can only ever exist localized
within the its time and is therefor temporary, and can only ever be relatively
fulfilled.  


Self enforced structure of rationality of which all decisions are constructed
piecemeal from sub-decisions through which maximum consensus can be formed on
all micro decisions. To engage in decisions making is to critique, reconfigure,
expand, clarify, form new elemental micro-decisions and associate connections
to larger decision maps.  This of course must be combined with democratic
decision process based on the amount individuals are affected by issues. The
community must then legitimize the use of the decision map for their usage to
be appropriate. The decision map of the thought is a constitution in this
regard. 

The decision map is constantly expanding streamlining, clarifying, and gaining
consent to further its legitimacy. 

The IPSDM may be thought of as a dictatorship of rationality and logic, even
though it is of course radically opposite from the historical and current
dictatorships of nation-states, as the combined thinking of the constituents
form and interpret the truths and rationality which form the basis to dictate
the decision making process. 


For the IPSDM there is no puzzle to small, no puzzle to tall. All large
problems and decisions must be systematically broken down into the smallest
agreeable pieces to then reconstruct the answer in a thoroughly understood and
rigorous way, such that it forms an sturdy and reliable link in the chain of
problems/or decisions that naturally expand outwards from the point.  Similarly
ever thought should be brought to its natural conclusion to not exclude any
possible avenues which may reveal new truth and better inform decisions.
Ostensibly, no reform of any kind should be excluded from consideration
provided the associated thoughts of said reform are considered to be truthful
and in line with the communities values and directives. 

The mechanism's goals are deterministically arrived at through rational
discussions and discourse of a philosophical nature. 

For inspiration (Wikipedia): (TODO cite original) 

 > The German scientist Reuleaux provides the definition "a machine is a
combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical
forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate
motion." In this context, his use of machine is generally interpreted to mean
mechanism.

In this vein, the Mechanism act's deterministically corresponding to reason and
rationality. Rationality here refers to the high level optimization between
sometimes competing decision making frameworks which will be referred to here
as _rationality-plurality_. Engaging in a decision making process through this
lens can aid that no single dogma (ex. economic-rationality) dominates to make
for short-sighted decisions. 

Governance must operate as social software designed to maximize consensus and
interoperability between actors whether those actors are individuals or groups.
All steps must be taken in unison and agreed upon by in large all significantly
affected parties as such to not ostracize members.  Although this process may
seem to be slow at the ignition of the mechanism, broad base consensus
procedures ensure system wise long term operation even as the mechanism
accelerates to inexplicable speeds. 

This governance interface should strive to be an infinite outlet for thought
work such that individuals have no maximum cap to the amount of expenditure
which can be directed at the IPSDM and which they can be confident that all
energy engaged with the network will ultimately push humanity towards positive
outcomes. All capable hands, independent of title or qualifications should feel
that they are able to participate in, learn from, and contribute to governance
at any capacity.  


The IPSDM is a subset of a larger set of decentralized governance
systems/abstractions which can exist and interact to form a global community In
this way the IPSDM is incentivized to maintain the larger state space of
decentralized governance abstractions to encourage the formation of new
communities which grow the network of global explicit interactions and
potentially to contribute within the decision map of the IPSDM.

This wider set of decentralized governance systems/abstractions should quite
easily contain all possible systems of existing governance, such that prevalent
governance structures existing today can be recreated identically to seamlessly
and peacefully transition communities of all forms towards more integratable
and democratic structures compatible with the IPSDM. These transitions can be
thought of analogous to backwards-compatible upgrade of societies. 


The aforementioned decision map should always strive to be expanded and
interoperable with other decision maps such As the decision map of one
community is expanded the corresponding nodes of connecting decision maps can
be queued for inclusion into other communities.  Naturally each community must
explicitly agree to all imported decision nodes from externally communities
before they can take affect. However, by developing decision maps as
interoperable potentially drastic amounts of duplicate work/thinking can be
avoided.  

the aforementioned decision map should also be simultaneously maintained in as
many spoken languages as to maximize engagement and promote a non-hegemonic
culture.  

In part, the IPSDM can be thought of as a high level tier within self
replicating space of dynamic decision maps. At the lowest level are individuals
which define their own decisions (with or without pre-defined maps), options
and always act unanimously as sovereign individuals. From here arbitrary tiers
of groups may form based on the freedom of association. The principle freedom
to associate, disassociate, regroup, redefine as a group which stands in unity.
The means of stabilization between freedoms of association is far from free and
will require significant effort from all parties of conflicting ideologies, but
may be heavily aided through the development of software/social
interoperability protocols.  Software/social protocols refers to mutually
agreed upon directives of community integration (for example to seek consensus)
from which a level of mutually agreeable rationality can be adopted and with it
the technological means of openly enforced that which is agreed upon across
arbitrary sovereign groups (ex. blockchains. This can be achieved through
incentive alignment 

In order for the IPSDM to maximize its capacity all incentives must be aligned
between actors within the network. Thus a value system and evaluation system
which can support this form of total alignment must be recognized, prized, and
materialized through all IPSDM compatible social software. 

In this way the IPSDM act as a sort of decentralized exchange of ideas and
conceptualizations whereby the labourer of thoughts is able to derived
exchangeable quantified units of value (cryptographic-tokens) for their
efforts.  Thus these forms of decentralized governance are qualitative yet
explicit while simultaneously maintain certain elements of a quantitative
economy, which eases integration with traditional money oriented systems. 


to assume that everything can and should be boiled down to an economic issue,
or an issue of simplistic quantifications are the result of a materialistic
mindset out of touch with the absolutely unique reality which all conscious
forms experience. It is void of the richness of life which distinguishes each
living creature from another, but attempts to deconstruct all uniqueness to
cold, breathless homogeneous abstractions often completely detached from
reality.  Everything can however be boiled down to an issue of rationality and
explainability, which does of course take place over discourse in the world of
ideas, which both contain both quantitative and qualitative analysis in an
attempt to discern the effective truth. Quantitative analysis should be viewed
as a discrete subset of qualitative analysis, as quantities are also qualities. 

The IPSDM should prize the _realm of ideas_ over the material world. The
creators, expressors and conduits of ideas (namely people) should be valued
over material possession. This can be extrapolated to convey that all people
both at their best and words should be protected to a greater degree than
property and possessions in all cases. Additionally we should be safeguarding
the means of communicating ideas, namely books, the internet etc. Above all
ownership models which may currently dictate the usage of said systems.  This
infrastructure which ensures the continued growth of humanity through
communication must be intelligently managed and never denied to the public, and
ideally collectively owned by the people as a whole. 

for the most people have largely not allowed themselves a means of coordinated
democratic qualitative negotiation but instead relegated the vast majority of
negotiation to the invisible hand of the quantified market. This hand holds no
uniform voice or certainly explainably rationality. The hand of the explicitly
rational combined qualitative and quantitative market of the IPSDM is visibly
explainable. 

we have the ability to transcend greed as a society, to be a part of something
bigger, when used properly the utility of quantified value systems has
undeniable benefits for resource allocation however we should not allow all
decisions to default to quantification issues in the face of new tools which
can allow us to arrive at rational decisions transparently and in consensus. 

we must proverbially and literally five the schools back to the kinds from
which all misaligned incentives present within the existing centralized
governance systems may be rectified

Societies are create as mono cultures, unadaptable ecologically non-diverse,
whereby disease may rapidly spread through the tendrils of the hierarchies,
destroying the capacity for society to flourish or controlling the outcome for
self serving purposes. 

a pseudo democracy is somewhat better than a dictatorship we are no-longer
subject to the whims of the dictator but instead subject to politicized
decisions based primarily on making ones opponents hated and ones constituents
trustworthy enough in time for the next election.  Image dominates while
constructive conversation about real issues is swept to the side, ignored or
intentionally hidden from the public. The capacity for leadership to make
important decisions based on long-term needs for survival is weakened in the
face of the never ceasing popularity contest which determines if their power,
and associated personal gains can be maintained or expanded [intimately tied
with the sense of self worth!] In conclusion although these leaders may not be
able to arbitrarily command death, they are capable and often incentivized to
lead entire societies towards collective ruin. 

Faith in the goodwill of our leadership can no longer be considered
satisfactory in the face of absolute certainty of the rational will of the
people. 

The IPSDM likely will form some form of pseudo hierarchy which gains its
legitimacy through being fully engaged with its population and thoroughly
decentralized. In this manner pseudo hierarchy refers not to a hierarchy of
implicit power, but the agreeable granting of (easily) revocable special
privleges to groups. 

Blockchains which enable special permissioned actors within their system could
choose to elect groups or individuals within their network to hold arbitrary
special privileges,  Note that special permissioned actors within decentralized
blockchains will likely evolve to be permissioned only as groups which all
individual members must be elected through continuous election. Here a special
permissioned group would only be capable of executing their special permissions
after consensus is reached among the group. Each member, as well as the group
as a whole, would therefore be incentivized to not abuse their privileges.
Additional safeguards for the community could be provided such as on-chain
“safety-deposits” which all members of special permissioned groups must provide
to the community as a whole.

no inferiority nor superiority with regards to the value of human life should
be called forward.  Independent of race religion gender social class,
language-spoken. beliefs or lack thereof, privilege, title, or any form of
conceivable classification which distinguishes between human life forms.
