# The Interplanetary Self-Defense Mechanism

The Interplanetary Self-Defense Mechanism (IPSDM) is humanities fail-safe.  The
_self_ appears when _it_ realizes itself as that which can be obliterated, and
must act to avoid injury. 

A decentralized public institution for the humans of earth

The Human Consensus engine

Capacity for humankind to self-organize, re-organize, and decentralize. 

Seeded in a world driven by self-interest, greed, and control, The Mechanism
must of an unkillable nature in order to fulfill its potentiality.  To attain
such status is to not exist as a physical entity but an idea, rooted in
explicitness, expressing itself cohesively through humans and technology. 

Within the digital age, ideas possess the quality of being unkillable. 
A well crafted, coherent, and comphrehensible idea has the power to transfigure our reality to the point
of unrecognizeablity through an unstoppable wave of positive actions. 
This is the challenge which must be fullfilled in order for humanity to continue its existence in the face
of seemingly insurmountable challenges. A new era of cooperation must be brought forth to enable outselves to coorinate as a species in ways 
never before seen. A true unity amongst humankind to once and for all put an end to widespread injustices, unfairnesses and unrest which 
inhibit out collective self-actualization. 

To do so we must create a new sense of belonging founded in tolerance respect,
love, and truth, which embraces individual critical thinking, peaceful
discourse and prizes rationality. The kind of rationality which encompassess
feelings and experiences and comprehensible logic and which fiercly rejects
dogmatic thinking of all forms

we must break free from the shackles of hatred, and transend our programming, bring forth a new overwhelming wave of peace and rational decision process
& reinstate a sense of wonder about the world for those who've lost it. 

the formation of a new paradimn predecated on truth























# RAW

The idea of a shared common fate is the beginning of a new kind of thinking
which mature into an altogether new form of self. The mechanism's _self_ is
never the sacrifice of individual personhood, for the self of the global
community. Core to its functionality is servicing Through art and culture,
which also remain dependent on the individual human, as being in some sense
individual. It is not about getting rid of fragmentation, but managing
plurality alongside unity. The one and the many, under the same yoke, a
paradox, never definitely resolved or stable, but basically creative. 

The mechanism's goals are deterministically arrived at through rational
discussions and discourse of a philosophical nature. 

For inspiration (Wikipedia): (TODO cite original) 

 > The German scientist Reuleaux provides the definition "a machine is a
combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical
forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate
motion." In this context, his use of machine is generally interpreted to
mean mechanism.

In this vein, the Mechanism act's deterministically corresponding to reason and
rationality. Rationality here refers to the high level optimization between
sometimes competing decision making frameworks which will be referred to here
as _rationality-plurality_. Engaging in a decision making process through this
lens can aid that no single dogma (ex. economic-rationality) dominates to
make for short-sighted decisions.
