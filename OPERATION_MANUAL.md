# General 

The Interplanetary Self-Defense Mechanism (IPSDM) is humanities fail-safe.  The
self appears when _it_ realizes itself as that which can be obliterated, and must
act to avoid injury. 

The idea of a shared common fate is the beginning of a new kind of thinking
which mature into an altogether new form of self. The mechanism's _self_ is
never the sacrifice of individual personhood, for the self of the global
community. Core to its functionality is servicing Through art and culture,
which also remain dependent on the individual human, as being in some sense
individual. It is not about getting rid of fragmentation, but managing
plurality alongside unity. The one and the many, under the same yoke, a
paradox, never definitely resolved or stable, but basically creative. 


The _Mechanism_'s mode's of operation include: 
 - Crisis 
 - Prevention 
 - Creation

Based on the mode of operation, The Mechanism will prioritize technological
development and mobilization based on the specific needs of humanity. 

The mechanism's goals are deterministically arrived at through rational
discussions and discourse of a philosophical nature. 

For inspiration (Wikipedia): (TODO cite original) 

 > The German scientist Reuleaux provides the definition "a machine is a
combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical
forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate
motion." In this context, his use of machine is generally interpreted to
mean mechanism.

In this vein, the Mechanism act's deterministically corresponding to reason and
rationality. Rationality here refers to the high level optimization between
sometimes competing decision making frameworks which will be referred to here
as _rationality-plurality_. Engaging in a decision making process through this
lens can aid that no single dogma (ex. economic-rationality) dominates to
make for short-sighted decisions. 


It takes heed to humanity and is: 
 - self-driven
 - self-sustaining
 - autonomous 


# Framework 

A network of physical communities are the basis 


# Maintenance 

The mechanism is self-maintaining. 

# Automoony 

TODO: we should probably have a section discussing the autonomous and sustainable elements of the mechanism
